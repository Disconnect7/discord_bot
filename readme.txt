# discord_bot

i use this bot to repost memes in discord 

1)create an aplication for discord, tutorial for ex: https://youtu.be/nW8c7vT6Hl4

2)rename "settings.txt.example" to "settings.txt"

3)fill settings.txt by your bot token (from step 1)
   if sucsess yor main.py print when running: "We have logged in as {bot name}#1234"
   and you can see that your bot is online
   
   also bot will respond to !тык command in DM

4.1) invite bot to servers you want to spam memes

4.2) fill (settings.txt) by your ID (also you can add your friends ID)

     fill (settings.txt) with ID of channels in which you want to repost memes
     (right click on channel and copy id, probably developer mod is discord settings need to activate to see it)
