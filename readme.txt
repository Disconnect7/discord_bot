# discord_bot

i use this bot to repost memes in discord 

1)create an aplication for discord, tutorial for ex: https://youtu.be/nW8c7vT6Hl4

2)fill {bot ID} in .env by your bot token, 
   if sucsess yor main.py print when running : We have logged in as {bot name}#1234
   and you can see that your bot is online
   
   also bot will respond to !тык command in DM

3.1) invite bot to servers you want to spam memes

3.2) fill (id_users.json) by your ID

     fill (channels_to_repost.json) with ID of channelsin which you want to repost memes
     (right click on channel and copy id, probably developer mod is discord settings need to activate to see it)
